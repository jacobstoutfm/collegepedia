***UNDERSTANDING POSTGRESQL AND REACT/NODE.JS CONNECTION***
PROGRAMS NEEDED:
Node.js / create-react-app [run through terminal]
Postgresql

For the time being, the databasepg.js file only querys 'Select * from users' 
and prints the user table in the terminal. This will be changed as time goes on.

**To launch our react-app, make sure after cd into the directory [collegepedia], enter npm start in the terminal.**
**If you run into an error launching, run npm audit fix --force in the terminal.**

Run npm i express pg if needed.

***If running npm start gives error about router, run npm i -D react-router-dom***
