A social-media platform that allows students to register, add, and rate professors, majors, schools, etc. This is a web application for CS 04400, Senior Project, Rowan University. Spring 2023. 

localhost:3000 -- Run and display the front-end.

localhost:4000 -- Run and display the login and registration (user-authentication) server.

localhost:5000 -- Run the backend server to populate data on the front-end.

To get started with this project, you just want to run this command:

npm run dev

This command should launch all three servers on their respective ports. 

Once all of the hosts are running, go to localhost:4000 on your browser.
This will launch the user authentication webpage, which once you register and login,
will bring you to the front-end and actual website [host:3000].
